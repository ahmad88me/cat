# TAbular DAta classification of soft clusters


###Assumptions
* There are no similar columns in the training set, e.g. city_name_english, city_name_french


###Ideas
* Add further (dummy) data to the training set if the user classified one column in the data set to be the same as one column in the training set that is not very similar.


###Open Questions
* What about sources that are neither RDF not CSV e.g. (databases)
