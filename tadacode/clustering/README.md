##Fuzzy Clustering:

- [x] implemented init membership
- [x] implemented the computation of the cluster centers for the fuzzy partitions
- [x] init membership random to be implemented
- [x] compute squared error
- [ ] check the difference, and if it is less than a threshold, stop
- [x] draw the points
- [x] compute the colors for the points to reflect the fuzziness
