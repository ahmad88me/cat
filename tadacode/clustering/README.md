### What is done lately in fuzzy_clustering
* implemented init membership
* implemented the computation of the cluster centers for the fuzzy partitions

### What to do next:
* init membership random to be implemented
* compute squared error
* only accept the new membership if it reduces the squared error
* add the loop in the fit function
* check the difference, and if it is less than a threshold, stop
* draw the points
* compute the colors for the points to reflect the fuzziness
